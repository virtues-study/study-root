# Virtues Map

This repository is a structured knowledge base exploring the relationships
between virtues, vices, and moral formation within the Catholic tradition.

The content here serves as:
- A textual and referenced source of truth
- A backend for relational visualization (Kumu)

## Structure
- `/virtues` — virtues grouped by type
- `/vices` — vices and distortions
- `/relations` — patterns of interaction
- `/references` — authoritative sources

## Visualization
The relationships between items are visualized using Kumu. 

Each document corresponds to a node in the graph.
